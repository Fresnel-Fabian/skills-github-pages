# What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, 
which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. 
Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.

The goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit
“intelligent behaviors” like humans, according to Boris Katz, 
a principal research scientist and head of the InfoLab Group at CSAIL. 
This means machines that can recognize a visual scene, understand a text written in natural language, 
or perform an action in the physical world.

Machine learning is one way to use AI. 
It was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer Arthur Samuel as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.”
